<h1><%= title("Partners") %></h1>
<p><strong>The successful development and implementation of the Academy has been possible through a positive partnership approach with key organsations. </strong></p>
<p>This approach has enabled a strong commitment to taking the model forward with organisations sharing expertise and resources free of charge.</p>
<p>The Care Quality Commission are one of our key partners and will also act as a vehicle to drive up standards of care through their monitoring process.</p>
